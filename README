2) Analyzing results

   The directory "data" contains data files holding test results.  One
   file for each subject.  See the (artificial) example data file
   below:

     $BASEDIR/data/unreal.noids.arff
   
   The data file is in the WEKA ".arff" format, as described in
   $BASEDIR/libs/README_weka.  More about the Machine Learning WEKA
   Software for Java can be found at:
   http://sourceforge.net/projects/weka/.

   Run the script below to obtain a classifier that generalizes the
   instance data on this file.

     $BASEDIR/analyze
