1) Running Tests 

   Each subject directory under src-subjects contains a script "s" for
   generating and execution tests.  The test generation process
   generates tests on a per-product basis.  It selects a set of VALID
   configurations from the file all-configurations.txt.  The test
   execution process executes each of those tests for a selection of
   randomly generated configurations (possibly INvalid).

   See the script src-subject/101Companies for an example of the
   script s.  TODO: move this script to $BASEDIR

2) Analyzing results

   The directory "data" contains data files holding test results.  One
   file for each subject.  See the (artificial) example data file
   below:

     $BASEDIR/data/unreal.noids.arff
   
   The data file is in the WEKA (*) ".arff" format, as described in
   $BASEDIR/libs/README_weka.

   Run the script below to obtain a classifier that generalizes the
   instance data on this file.

     $BASEDIR/analyze
